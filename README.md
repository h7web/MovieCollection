# MovieCollection
My personal movie collection, as a tool to work with interesting technologies
Currently this is using MVC/MVVM in a microsoft stack. The db is MS SQL Server 16. 
It makes use of the omdb api for accessing data from the popular internet movie database (IMDB)

that way, it imports the requested information directly and I only have to match directors since names change, give it my categorization, since IMDB uses many more categories than I want to work with, and what format(s) I have the movie in.
